I am currently employed as a Software Engineer at Booz Allen Hamilton on the Digital team. Our main focus is to provide clients with modern web applications that are scalable, easily deployable, and maintainable.

Some of the practices which I have seen the benefit of first hand are DevOps, Test Driven Development, Agile, and Microservices. Having worked on both development and devops/automation roles, I consider myself a fullstack engineer. 

Previous to Booz Allen Hamilton I held intern positions at Mentalix Inc and Zodiac Aerospace working on software development, testing, and delivery.

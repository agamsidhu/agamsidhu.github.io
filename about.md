I am currently a full-stack developer at Trintech working on a financial application built on the ASP.NET framework. I develop features vital to fulfilling our customers financial needs and work on migrating code to REST API and Single Page architecture using Web-API and Angular.

Prior, I worked at Booz Allen Hamilton on the Digital team as a consultant. My main focus was to provide clients with modern web applications that are scalable, easily deployable, and maintainable.

Some of the practices which I have seen the benefit of first hand are DevOps, Test Driven Development, Agile, and Microservices. I have worked on both development and DevOps/automation roles, and thoroughly enjoy both. Perhaps in the future I will look towards architecture and project planning. 

I created this site to help document the things I learn in my career along with sharing some of my hobbies. You will find posts about software, best practices, book reviews, cooking and travelling.

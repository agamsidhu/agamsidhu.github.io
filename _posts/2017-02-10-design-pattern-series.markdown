At some point on the road to becoming a great developer one must learn about and start applying design patterns to their code. Design patterns are solutions to commonly occurring problems that people smarter than me have already organized into a set of reusable solutions and provide us with a template for how to solve a problem that can be used in many situations. Design patterns do not worry about the specifics, but rather on the relationships between the classes and how to best design them to reduce issues and increase maintainability. As we all know, change is the only thing that is guaranteed in the industry and the patterns are designed to help us deal with that change easily. 

One of the biggest benefits of learning the patterns is being able to effectively communicate with other developers on how to best solve an issue the team is facing. I have personally read about and used solutions to an issue and only now did I realize that I was using a design pattern to design the solution. I would also encourage those who frequently post on stackoverflow to point out when they answer questions that they are using design patterns to assist the poster. 

In this series I will explain the patterns, what problems they solve, and how to implement them in code. Since I am currently working full time with C# the code examples will be in C#, however they can easily be translated to Java.
